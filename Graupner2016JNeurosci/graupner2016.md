**Fig. 1, 3 and 5 : Plasticity for irregular spike pairs**

<img src="outputFigures/Graupner2016JNeurosci_linearCaModel.png" width="600px" />

The data has to be first calculated by running `irregularPairs_Ca-Model.py` for the linear calcium dynamics model.
For the linear calcium dynamics model, the calcium integral is calculated semi-analytically in a C++ program,
which has to be compiled first by running `make` in the `timeAboveThreshold` directory.
The compound figure is subsequently generated by the script `Graupner2016JNeurosci_linearCaModel.py`.

```python
python irregularPairs_Ca-Model.py
python Graupner2016JNeurosci_linearCaModel.py
```

**Fig. 9 : Plasticity for irregular spike pairs in the calcium based model with nonlinear calcium dynamics**

<img src="outputFigures/Graupner2016JNeurosci_nonlinearCaModel.png" width="600px" />

The data has to be first calculated by running `irregularPairs_nonlinear-Ca-Model.py` for the
nonlinear calcium dynamics model. The compound figure is subsequently generated by the script
`Graupner2016JNeurosci_nonlinearCaModel.py`.

```python
python irregularPairs_nonlinear-Ca-Model.py
python Graupner2016JNeurosci_nonlinearCaModel.py

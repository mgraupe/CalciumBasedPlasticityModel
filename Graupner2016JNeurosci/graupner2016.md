The data has to be first calculated by running `irregularPairs_Ca-Model.py` for the linear calcium dynamics model and
`irregularPairs_nonlinear-Ca-Model.py` for the nonlinear calcium dynamics model.
For the linear calcium dynamics model, the calcium integral is calculated semi-analytically in a C++ program,
which has to be compiled first by running `make` in the `timeAboveThreshold` directory.
The compound figures are subsequently generated by the scripts `Graupner2016JNeurosci_linearCaModel.py`
and `Graupner2016JNeurosci_nonlinearCaModel.py`. In other words, the png and pdf versions of the linear calcium
dynamics figures can be produced by running the following two scripts

```python
python irregularPairs_Ca-Model.py
python Graupner2016JNeurosci_linearCaModel.py
```

Equivalently, for the nonlinear calcium dynamics model
```python
python irregularPairs_nonlinear-Ca-Model.py
python Graupner2016JNeurosci_nonlinearCaModel.py
```
